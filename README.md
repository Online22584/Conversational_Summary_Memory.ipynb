# Conversational Summary Memory

## Overview
This project implements a system for generating conversational summaries using memory-based techniques. The goal is to distill key points from multi-turn conversations into concise, coherent summaries. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook named `Conversational_Summary_Memory.ipynb`.

## Features
- **Memory-Augmented Summarization**: Leverages memory mechanisms to retain context across conversation turns.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Handles long and complex dialogues effectively.
- **Customizable Summaries**: Allows users to adjust the level of detail in the generated summaries.
- **Visualization**: Displays intermediate memory states and summary generation steps.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  transformers
  torch
  numpy
  pandas
  matplotlib
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Conversational_Summary_Memory.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Conversational_Summary_Memory
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `Conversational_Summary_Memory.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load sample conversation data.
   - Train or fine-tune the summarization model.
   - Generate and visualize conversational summaries.

## How It Works
1. **Data Input**: The system takes multi-turn conversational data as input.
2. **Memory Mechanism**: A memory module retains relevant context from previous turns.
3. **Summary Generation**: A pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT) generates summaries based on the retained context.
4. **Evaluation**: Summaries are evaluated for coherence, relevance, and conciseness.

## Example
- **Input**: A multi-turn conversation between two participants.
- **Output**: A summary highlighting the main points of the conversation.

### Sample Input
```
Person A: How's the project going?
Person B: It's progressing well. We just completed the initial phase.
Person A: Great! What's next?
Person B: We'll start the testing phase next week.
```

### Sample Output
```
Summary: The project is progressing well. The initial phase is complete, and testing will begin next week.
```

## Customization
You can modify the notebook to:
- Use different pre-trained models for summarization.
- Adjust memory mechanisms for improved context retention.
- Train on custom datasets for domain-specific applications.
